Cover design for the CD and digital release. CGI generated imagery is contrasted with handwritten elements and rough cut-outs of band photographs.

Taking references from the 1920 silent horror film ‘The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari’ — which was an inspiration for the band during recording — and adding a virtual pink noir feeling to it.
