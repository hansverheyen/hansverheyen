Profile, Bubble, Cloud is a three-part animation about distortion in the online world, specifically issues surrounding the manipulation of information.

What if we look at data as a way to build a reality? As a substance that distorts your identity? This idea is explored through narrative and digitally created environments and animations. Three chapters, each showing a different viewpoint with a short story narrated by captions.

Profile as the distortion that occurs in the way an online identity is perceived, Bubble as the isolating personal experience and Cloud as a digital dump full of automatic generated nonsense and absurd fragments.
