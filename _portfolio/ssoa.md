Artwork for a cancelled outdoor music event during the summer of 2020. The event would have taken place at the park Boeienweide in the vicinity of Antwerp. The park is home to some old shipping buoys which I recreated in 3D software and placed in a imaginative surrounding. 

The poster campaign consisted of three different images, each picturing one of the buoys that would have been seen at the event location.
